# tmux-sessions

A Rust TUI reimplementation of tmux's `choose-tree` — a tree-based session/window/pane picker with preview.

## Architecture

**TEA (Elm Architecture)**: App state + Action enum + pure update function + render function.

```
src/
  main.rs    — entry point, terminal setup/teardown, unified AppEvent loop, 3 worker threads
  app.rs     — App state, Mode, handle_action (TEA update), PreviewPane struct
  config.rs  — optional config loading (~/.config/tmux-sessions/config.json), format_session_name
  create.rs  — create-session popup sources: history/worktree/zoxide tabs and candidate types
  tmux.rs    — all tmux command interaction (list/kill/switch/capture); move_window, capture_pane_raw, get_mode_style, parse_style functions
  tree.rs    — NodeId enum, FlatEntry struct, flatten/format_line for tree rendering
  history.rs — recently-closed session history (~/.config/tmux-sessions/history.json): load/prune, upsert live sessions
  ui.rs      — render: vertical layout, List-based tree, preview, confirmation overlay
  event.rs   — map KeyEvent + Mode → Action enum
  procs.rs   — process monitor: pane enumeration, ps parsing, subtree ownership
```

### Threading / event model

`main.rs` owns a single `mpsc::Receiver<AppEvent>` and three worker threads:

- **Input thread**: polls crossterm events → sends `AppEvent::Input`
- **Capture worker**: receives `CaptureRequest`, runs `tmux capture-pane` (blocking, off UI thread) → sends `AppEvent::CaptureDone { generation, node_id, panes }`
- **Formatter worker**: receives `FormatRequest`, runs the configured formatter script → sends `AppEvent::NameFormatted { raw_name, formatted }`

The main loop blocks on `recv` (or `recv_timeout` when Monitor mode or debounce is pending). On timeout: dispatch the debounced capture request and/or tick the monitor.

### Preview caching and debounce

`update_preview()` sets `pending_preview_request` with a 40ms deadline (not immediate). `dispatch_capture_request` only sends to the worker when `Instant::now() >= deadline`. This debounces `j`/`k` scrolling to ~one capture when the cursor settles.

`preview_cache: HashMap<NodeId, Vec<PreviewPane>>` stores the last successful capture per node. On selection change: show cached content immediately (SWR), kick a background refresh. Show "capturing..." only when no cache entry exists.

### Formatter caching (SWR)

Sessions start with raw names. `formatter_cache: HashMap<String, String>` is in-memory only. On startup and after refresh, uncached live sessions are enqueued to the formatter worker. Dead sessions are formatted lazily when the filter (`/`) is active. `apply_name_formatted()` updates `display_name` for matching live and dead sessions and rebuilds flat_entries.

## Key Conventions

- **Delimiter**: `\x1f` (ASCII unit separator) in tmux format strings to avoid issues with names containing colons
- **No destructuring**: Access struct fields directly (`obj.field`), never `let { field } = obj`
- **No dummy/fallback values**: Propagate errors properly, don't use `unwrap_or("")` style fallbacks
- **Flat-entry model**: Tree is flattened into `Vec<FlatEntry>` based on which nodes are in the `opened` set, rebuilt on expand/collapse/refresh
- **NodeId**: Enum with `Group(prefix)` / `Session(id)` / `Window(session_id, window_id)` / `Pane(session_id, window_id, pane_id)` — used as tree identifier and for resolving actions; `Group` nodes are no-ops for select/kill/pin
- **Tree rendering**: Manual connector characters (`├─>`, `└─>`, `│`) and `+`/`-` symbols matching tmux's native choose-tree
- **Mode-style**: tmux mode-style is read at startup to derive `highlight_style` and `primary_color`

## Configuration

Optional config file at `~/.config/tmux-sessions/config.json`:

```json
{
  "formatter": "/path/to/format-session.sh",
  "group_name_separator": "/",
  "zoxide": true
}
```

- **formatter**: Path to a script that receives the raw session name as its first argument and prints the formatted name to stdout
- **group_name_separator**: Groups sessions by the prefix before the first occurrence of this separator in their `display_name`. Sessions without the separator appear ungrouped at the root level. Groups start expanded and can be collapsed/expanded with `h`/`l`. Pinned sessions are pulled out of their group and shown at the top (with the same separator as in flat mode); group counts reflect only unpinned members.
- **zoxide**: Enables the create-session popup's zoxide tab when set to `true` and the `zoxide` binary is installed
- Missing config file → raw session names used (no error)
- Invalid JSON → app fails to start with error
- Formatter failure (missing script, non-zero exit, empty output) → per-session fallback to raw name
- `Session.name` is always the raw tmux name (used for tmux commands); `Session.display_name` is what the UI shows

## Reopening closed sessions

- Every refresh snapshots live sessions (name + `#{session_path}` cwd + `last_seen`) into `~/.config/tmux-sessions/history.json` (`history::upsert_live_sessions`). A name in history but not in the live list is a "dead" session.
- Dead sessions surface **only** in `/` filter results — `flatten_filtered` fuzzy-scores them and appends below live matches, dimmed (`Modifier::DIM`), as `NodeId::DeadSession(name)`. They never appear in the unfiltered tree, and are no-ops for pin/kill/preview.
- `Enter` on a dead session resumes it: `tmux new-session -d -s <name> -c <cwd>` then `switch-client` (single window at the captured cwd — no layout restore).
- History is pruned on load: entries older than 30 days (`HISTORY_MAX_AGE_SECS`) or whose `cwd` no longer exists are dropped.

## Dependencies

- `ratatui` — TUI framework

In move-window mode:
- type to search sessions or enter a new session name
- `↓` / `Ctrl-N` — move down through candidates

## Create session

Press `o` to open a create/resume popup with Tab / Shift+Tab cycling across the available sub-tabs:

- **History** — always visible. Fuzzy-matches recently closed sessions and can resume them or create a new named session from the current query.
- **Worktree** — visible only when the current working directory is inside a git repo with linked worktrees (`git worktree list --porcelain` returns more than one worktree).
- **Zoxide** — visible only when `"zoxide": true` is set in `config.json` and `zoxide` is installed on `PATH`.

In create-session mode:
- type to search candidates or enter a new session name
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` — cycle tabs
- `↓` / `Ctrl-N` — move down through candidates
- `↑` / `Ctrl-P` — move up through candidates
- `Enter` — switch to an existing live session, resume a dead one, or create a new one
- `Esc` — cancel

In fullscreen preview mode:
- `h` / `←` — previous pane
- `l` / `→` — next pane
- `Enter` — switch to previewed pane
- `Esc` — return to tree
